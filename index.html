      <h3>Why <em>programming?</em></h3>
        <p>My passion for Web Development is my main motivation.I find it fascinating to be able to just go online and access a webapp that provides exactly what you need.
          <br>
          I enjoy creating works of art from scratch.The lifecycle of a web application from an idea to implementation is a very fulfiling to understand.
