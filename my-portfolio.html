      <h3>Why <em>programming?</em></h3>
        <p>I decided to study programming because of my passion in web design.
            As a model I often require to have an up-to-date portfolio of myself.I am very keen to improve my 
            coding skills and hopefully <strong>transfer that knowledge to someone in the future.</strong>
